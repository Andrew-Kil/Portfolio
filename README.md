## To-Do

### Complete

- [x] make github calendar widget responsive
- [x] clicking on nav links navigates user to incorrect position on website due to the sticky navbar

### Incomplete

- [ ] considering website performance, replace project screenshots with gifs to demo the site
- [ ] make sure project images are all the same size (some are slightly off)
- [ ] in projects, the small tag will cause the height to vary depending on how much text is inside, make them uniform
- [ ] replace png images with image types that decrease loading time
- [ ] adjust sizing/width of components such as about text, contact form on mobile
- [ ] update about text
- [ ] when user clicks on a navlink in the navbar hamburger menu, find a way to collapse the hamburger menu instead of having it persist
- [ ] consider adding skills (using either icons or text)
- [ ] add comments and spaces for different components
