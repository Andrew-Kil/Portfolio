# To-Do

- [ ] considering website performance, replace project screenshots with gifs to demo the site
- [ ] make github calendar widget responsive
- [ ] make sure project images are all the same size (some are slightly off)
- [ ] in projects, the small tag will cause the height to vary depending on how much text is inside, make them uniform
- [ ] clicking on nav links navigates user to incorrect position on website due to the sticky navbar
